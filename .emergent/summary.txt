The AI engineer successfully progressed the React Native Expo marketplace app, transforming its UI/UX to an Uber-like experience. Initial work involved establishing a Material 3 design, core navigation, and a FastAPI backend with authentication, Stripe, Firebase chat, and Emergent LLM integration. Key challenges included  compatibility,  import errors, and  context issues, all resolved through systematic debugging, cache clearing, and code adjustments. The engineer implemented comprehensive notification and rating systems, refactored chat to use real backend data, and developed various Uber-like UI components and real-time backend services (WebSocket, provider status, nearby search). The project is in an advanced state, with backend fully tested and frontend components created for core functionalities, currently moving towards integrating these into the main screens.

<product_requirements>
The application is a single React Native app for iOS/Android, dynamically adapting based on  or  roles. It must prioritize performance (60fps), accessibility (AA), dark mode, responsive design, and a Google-like Material 3 design. The primary interface is a map with a contextual . Core features include Onboarding, Login/SignUp (Email/Password, Google/Apple), Profile, Settings, Notifications, Chat, and History. Client flows require service request creation, finding/accepting provider offers, tracking, Stripe payment, and rating. Provider flows involve online/offline toggling, receiving/accepting/refusing requests, status updates (A caminho / Cheguei / Em servi√ßo), and service finalization. The app requires empty/loading/error states, map integration (Google Maps/Directions API), Firebase Realtime Database for chat, AI features, and Socket.IO for real-time communication. The overall styling and UX/UI should be Uber-like, with dynamic animations for maps, searching, and status updates, along with a provider earnings dashboard.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI) and  (React Native Expo) directories.


-   : The main FastAPI app, now includes , , and WebSocket endpoints from .
-   : Handles API routes for creating and retrieving service reviews, including a fix for .
-   : Contains logic for push notifications and API routes to manage tokens and send notifications.
-   : New module for WebSocket communication, handling connections, and broadcasting service requests/updates.
-   : Root layout, now includes  for real-time capabilities.
-   : Main entry point, updated to handle authentication-based redirection using .
-   : Centralized API service. Corrected URL concatenation (removed double ) and added generic HTTP methods (, , , ).
-   : Manages user authentication state. Fixed error handling during login and potentially a timing issue for web redirection.
-   : Refactored to remove mocked data and integrate with real backend chat APIs, also fixed  import path.
-   , : Updated to be more robust, preventing  undefined errors by ensuring theme context availability.
-   : New context to manage WebSocket connections and messages for real-time features.
-   : Updated to integrate with the backend push notification services.
-   : New hook to manage rating logic in the frontend.
-   : New hook to consume real-time service updates via WebSockets.
-   : New hook to manage service tracking states.
-   : Primary home screen, significantly refactored to an Uber-like interface, incorporating , , and updated  content. Text Para onde vamos? changed to Que servi√ßo voc√™ precisa?.
-   , : Modified to act as placeholders after  was removed.
-   : New component for a cross-platform map solution.
-   , : New UI components for the rating system.
-   : New Uber-like search bar component, with corrected text Que servi√ßo voc√™ precisa? and layout adjustments.
-   : Modified/new component for an interactive bottom sheet.
-   : New component for tracking service status in real-time.
-   : New component for providers to toggle their online/offline status.
-   : New component for displaying search animations for providers.
-   : New modal component for provider service requests.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently focusing on completing the Uber-like UI/UX refinement and integrating real-time functionalities. This involves creating various frontend components and backend services. The latest backend work includes a robust WebSocket system, provider online/offline status, and nearby provider search, all thoroughly tested (48/49 tests approved). On the frontend, new components such as , , , and  have just been created. The immediate next step is to integrate these newly created components into the main application screens, specifically starting with , to build out the client and provider flows as per the Uber-like UX design.
